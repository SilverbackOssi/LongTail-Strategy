# LongTail Trading Strategy

An Expert Advisor that implements the LongTail trading strategy, designed to capitalize on trends while surviving ranging markets.

## Overview

LongTail is a modified version of the Remora strategy that uses a 1:R reward system (where R > 1). The current implementation focuses on a 1:3 reward ratio.

### Key Features

- Dynamic grid-based trading system
- Automated recovery mechanism for ranging markets
- Daily session management capability 
- Progression sequence for position sizing
- Advanced delay management for price gaps

## Strategy Components

The EA is organized into several key components:

- **Core Management**
  - Daily session control
  - Position monitoring
  - Strategy rule enforcement

- **Grid Management**
  - Exit position handling
  - Recovery position placement
  - Continuation order management

- **Risk Management**
  - Dynamic position sizing
  - Progressive lot sequence
  - Multiple validation checks

## Configuration

Key parameters that can be configured:

```
input bool   use_daily_session = false;  // Enable/disable daily sessions
input int    multiplier = 3;             // Reward multiplier
input int    sequenceLength = 50;        // Length of progression sequence
```

Default session times (when daily sessions enabled):
- Start: 08:30
- End: 18:30

## Requirements

- MetaTrader 5 Platform
- Account with appropriate broker permissions
- Sufficient margin for progression sequence
