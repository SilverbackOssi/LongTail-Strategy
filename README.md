# Documentation 
LongTails is modified version of the Remora strategy, designed to capitalize on trends and last through ranges. Parent versions were based on a 1:1 reward system, but this is a 1:R; where R is greater that 1. For this study our focus is on 1:3.

### Strength and weakness

Like every other MarketCrusher, LongTails thrives in a trending market and dies in a ranging market. This model seems to outlive other models in ranging markets although we‚Äôre yet to discover the maximum range it survives.

### Dependencies and Market analysis

- none

### **Scope**

- Study was performed on XAU/USD pair, hence **grid_spread**/**range_spread** = 40*points*
- Potentially Volatility 75 and 75(1s)

### Entry rules

- set trading time(daily session)
    - Start time = 7:30am
    - EndSession = False

### Exit rules

- end of trading day, no new cycle.
    - End time = 5:30pm
    - EndSession = True(default)

### Worrisome events

These events create unforeseen circumstances 

- Slippage
- Spread

### Assumptions
- ***The grid is either progressing or in a range***

# Strategy Guide

- **Core guides**
    1. *Progression sequence is predefine by a function, initiated on start.*
    2. *Only one position can be open at a time.* 
    3. *Only two pending order can be present at a time.* 
    4. *All buy stops are to be placed 40points(range_spread) above the supposed price. Two consecutive buy stops will not be placed on the same price.* 
    5. *Fatal error error is raised when unforeseen event occurs.*

- **Glossary**
    - What is a progression cycle?
        *All the trades it takes to hit TP once.*
        *Each cycle is independent from predecessors, but references position type and volume only.*
    - Continuation delay:  
        *situation where buy stops are placed higher(fixed distance) than the take profit of a long position*
        *price would hit take profit and not trigger a new position because of our range_spread, leaving us with no open position and two pending orders(tap and reverse response).*
    - Range delay:  
        *situation where buy stops are placed higher(fixed distance) than the stop loss of a short position*
        *Price would be within a range and hit range ceiling but not trigger a buy stop because of our range_spread, therefore there‚Äôs no open position but two pending orders.*
    - **These delays ensure that the grid is not fixed buy constantly moving; the grid moves upward in response to a range**

- **Likely events within a progression cycle?**
    - Extended range: *Price might stay within a worrisome range where our stop loss falls for an extended period incurring unnecessary losses* 
    - Tap and reverse: *A pending order might be triggered by spread when a position is still open therefore leaving two active positions. Sometimes the older positions reverses and closes a loss, leaving us with two grudges to deal with a creating chaos in the system.* 
    - Misplaced orders: *An order may be left mis-priced as the grid progresses or ranges, due to slippage(all orders needs to be renewed as grid moves).* 
    - Replacement order: *during range delay a continuation order is to be removed and replaced by a recovery order.* 
    - Carry over: *some market days are slow, those days we don't hit daily target. running progression cycles are held running unto the next day.* 

- **Risk management caution**
    - Ensure progression sequence is accurate and relative to account balance. üèÅ
    - Ensure lot sizes are pricked properly from the sequence.
    - Ensure take profit and stop loss is set on all positions.

- **General Caution**
    - ensure no continuation order outside daily session.
    - ensure this is no Forgotten order. *An order may be forgotten after a daily session ends, leading to unintended outcomes.*

## Requirements

### Daily sessions management(CORE) ‚òëÔ∏è‚òëÔ∏è
```
if Outside trading time:
    EndSession = True
    delete non recovery orders
    return 
else:
    EndSession = False

    if an order or a position is on the chart:
        #a progression cycle is still running
        return
    else:
        open a short position at market price
        
```
### New position management(logic)‚òëÔ∏è‚òëÔ∏è
```
saved ticket = 0 #default
def check new position():
    if position is open
        get open positions ticket
        if saved ticket ‚â† open positions ticket:
            call set exits
            
            delete all pending orders.
            
            call recovery.
            
            call continuation if not endsession.
            
            update stored ticket to open ticket
```
### Inadvertent event management(logic)‚òëÔ∏è
```
if there are more than one positions

    raise fatal error, close bot. log event.

if there are more that two orders:

    raise fatal error, close bot. log event.
```
### Zero position management(logic) ‚òëÔ∏è

*manages all delay*

reasons: outside trading time, a position just closed leaving a delay, fatal error(unforeseen)
```
if there are no open positions:

    # reason : a position just closed within trading time leaving a delay
    if there are two tickets: # theres a delay 

        call range delay management

        return
    # reason: outside trading time
    if use_daily_session and EndSession: 

        # reset relevant params, currently none
        if theres a ticket:
            Delete any order whose comment does not contain 'recovery', log what you deleted
        
            call range delay management
        
        return
    # reason: fatal error,unforeseen event
    else: fatal error log current terminal status #number of open positions etc. for journaling
```

### Range delay management(logic)‚òëÔ∏è
‚ÜíTo set up range delay

### Exit management(called)‚òëÔ∏è‚òëÔ∏è
‚ÜíSets take profit and stop loss on an open position
```
def set exits(position ticket, grid_size, reward multiplier)
    get ticket details

    determine tp and sl

    modify open position
```

### Recovery management(called) ‚òëÔ∏è‚òëÔ∏è

‚Üíplaces one order *(opposite of the reference ticket type)*
```
def place recovery order(reference ticket)

    if ticket is open:
        get ticket detail
        check if stop loss present
        
        order lot = next term of the sequence, relative to the reference(currently open) ticket
    
    else if ticket is a buy stop:
    
        order lot = reference ticket lot
    
    else: fatal error(unforeseen), return
    
    place pending order of type opposite to the ticket type
```
---

**buy stop as recovery position:** recovery buy stops are placed grid_spread higher than the short position‚Äôs stop loss.

**sell stop as recovery order:** recovery sell stops are placed on the stop loss of a long position or a buy stop (range delay)

### Continuation management(called) ‚òëÔ∏è‚òëÔ∏è

‚Üí*places one order (continuation order) relative to open positions, during trading time*
```
def place continuation order(reference ticket)

    if EndSession: return
    
    if ticket is still open:
        get ticket details
        check if take profit is set

        get lot size as first term of the progression sequence
        
        check if order already exists
        place a stop order similar to the open position‚Äôs type
    
    else: fatal error
```
---

**buy stop as continuation position:** continuation buy stops are placed grid_spread higher than the long position‚Äôs take profit.

**sell stop as continuation order:** continuation sell stops are placed on the take profit of a short position.

### Sequence builder(called) ‚òëÔ∏è‚òëÔ∏è
```
def Initialize progression sequence(reward multiplier)

- Ensure lot sizes(lot progression sequence) are accurate
- relative to account balance üèÅ (not yet, we use symbol minimum volume)

return an array with progression sequence.
```
---
## Utility functions

- Rules enforcer utils
- delete all pending orders, if there are orders.
- fatal error(error location, error message). removes bot and reports event.
- XXX

## Session report logging

report to telegram daily.

Post-daily_session logging. 11:30pm

- log all closed positions(position is closed if ticket cannot be selected)
- Log the total number of progression cycles. (account for running progressions if any)
- log total  trading time.
- Log percentage profit or loss of the day.

### To-Do

- [ ] re adjust sequence and how it is progressed. Re asses session time management.
- [ ]  Confirm all functions take args and not reference global vars, and are passed by reference when updates are needed
- [ ]  List all utility func
- [ ]  observe live trading for more unaccounted events.
- [ ]  test without continuation range, it might be unnecessary.
- [ ]  Include image description
- [ ] Code for all activities to be logged; position open/close, order open/close, managements and sessions, etc.
- [ ] Handle failed buys, sells, etc
- [ ] Include docstring for all functionalities
- [ ] Include Strategy definition
- [ ] Clean up README, separate pseudo code
- [ ] Allow ea to manage multiple charts by confirming symbol before any operation- CheckRules,
- Script to detect slippages between two 15m candles, price must fill, 1:2 - camera photo on 12 feb.2025
- confirm short scalps strategy idea - screen shot on 13th feb.2025
