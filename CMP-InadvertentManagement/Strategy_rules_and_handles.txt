General caution
Ensure no continuation order placed outside daily session.
    - place_continuation function only responds when EndSession ==false (during trading session)
    - sessions management function deletes all orders except recovery orders outside daily session
Ensure no order is left pending after a progression cycle outside daily session(forgotten position)
    - post_session_clean_up() is called when there is no open position   

Risk caution
Ensure progression sequence is accurate and relative to account balance.
    - progression sequence is accurate but not relative to account balance yet.
    - XXX
Ensure lot sizes are pricked properly from the sequence. 
    - all function that send orders/positions pick their lot from the progression sequence
    - recovery stop, continuation stop, daily session
Ensure take profit and stop loss is set on all positions.
    - take profit and stop loss are set on every new open position

Event caution
Misplaced orders
    - when a new position is opened all pending orders are deleted and replaced by relevant orders
Tap and reverse
    - all functions that place buy stops spread them range_spread higher than the ideal price, allowing an order to close properly(Continuation delay) and a dynamic grid(Range delay).    
Extended range
    - all functions that place buy stops spread them range_spread higher than the ideal price, allowing an order to close properly(Continuation delay) and a dynamic grid(Range delay).    
Carry over
    - progression cycles are handled (TP/SL is set and recovery is set) regardless of EndSession status
Replacement order
    - check_range_delay() ensures lagging sell stops are replaced with recovery sell stops

Core rules

    - check_core_rules()
Range spread rule
    - all functions that place buy stops spread them range_spread higher than the ideal price, allowing an order to close properly(Continuation delay) and a dynamic grid(Range delay).    
Define sequence on initialization
    - build_sequence() builds the array based on the symbols minimum volume(for testing)
